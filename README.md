# NCPI-DDENT
NCPI Data Dictionary and NLP Tool

NCPI DDENT is a prototype web service intended to extract variables metadata from DbGAP studies and build FHIR ConceptMaps linking those variables to healthcare terms such as SNOMED, LOINC, etc. 

While work on the prototype has stopped, the interst in mapping study specific variables to common terminologies is very real and is likely to be revisted once some of the initial work has been completed migrating DbGAP study information into FHIR.
